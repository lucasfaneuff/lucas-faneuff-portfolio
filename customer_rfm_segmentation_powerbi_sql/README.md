# Customer Segment Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a retail food company's customer base to uncover behavioural patterns and segment customers using the RFM framework. The goal is to help marketing and strategy teams improve business decisions, better understand customer value, improve retention, and guide targeted outreach.

The analysis includes end-to-end data work: cleaning, transforming, SQL queries, customer clustering logic, and a Power BI dashboard for interactive insight exploration.

- Poor retention among high value segment
- Low personalization of marketing campaigns
- No understanding of purchasing patterns

The projects solves this through identification of customer segments and further recommended actions for each group

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Power BI (Interactive dashboard)
- Excel

## 🧼 Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Creating database tables from raw data
- Standardizing date formats and categorical values
- Handling missing values
- Creating key variables

## 📊 Methodology
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Examined patterns in customer behaviour, generated core summary statistics and analyzed behaviour at a customer level

### 2. RFM Segmentation
Calculated:
- Recency score
- Frequency score
- Monetary score

Generated 10 customer segments:
- Loyalist
- Potential Loyal
- New Customer
- Growing
- Promising
- Est. Spender
- Big Spender
- Loyal (At Risk)
- Customer At Ridk
